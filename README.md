# ForecastingLaborForceParticipation
Final paper and Jupyter notebooks for my JHU Macroeconomic-Forecasting course.

My collaborator and co-author, Madalyn Beban, and I completed this paper for our Macroeconomic Forecasting course.  Our goal in this paper was mainly to showcase forecasting methods learned in the course, and demonstrate our ability to select appropriate functional forms for a forecasting model based on evaluation of series plots, correlograms, fitness metrics, and economic theory. 

The final paper is best viewed in Word, but we've included our Jupyter notebook here to show our full code and analysis.  Analysis was done mainly with Pandas, Statsmodels, and matplotlib packages.
